## This document defines the protocol for Member-Conductor and Member-Member communications.
### Authors:
* Edward Beeching     (Team D)
* Valentin Benozillo  (Team E)
* Jorge Chong         (Team D)
* Ishwer Purushotham  (Team F)

### Key points:
 * All messages start with a 4 character string to identify the message
 * All messages are encoded as UTF-8
 * Throughout this document we write " \r\n " with white space, this is to make the doc. more readable, the white space should not be included in the actual protocol
 * FILENAME should be limited to a maximum of 256 characters
 * Checksums are computed with the SHA-1 checksum
 * All communications are made over a TCP connection
 * KEY POINT!! Connections made between members are two-way, requests are made in both directions (possibly simultaneously depending on implementation) a connection is not a client-server relationship!
	
### 1. Orchestra file

The .orch file is defined as follows:

    CONDUCTOR IP:PORT
    FILENAME
    FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM
    FILE SIZE IN BYTES
    PART SIZE IN BYTES
    NUMBER OF PARTS
    CHECKSUM OF PART1
    CHECKSUM OF PART2
    ...............
    CHECKSUM OF LAST PART
 
Example:

    192.168.1.1:9999
    maxresdefault.jpg
    2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705

### 2. Member-Conductor communications

#### 2.1 How a member requests a list of IP:ports from the conductor
   The member sends the following message over TCP (after making a normal connection, not by using the IP and port of the conductor as provided in the .orch file):

		DOWN \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <PORT> \r\n 

		Example:

		DOWN \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 9999 \r\n
		
#### 2.2 There are two possible replies
##### 2.2.1 	The server does not have a list of IP:ports for this file:
		
		NONE \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n 

		 Example:

		NONE \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 
		
##### 2.2.2 The server has a list of IP:ports for this file:
		
		SEND \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n NUMBER \r\n 
		IP:PORT \r\n 
		IP:PORT \r\n 
		IP:PORT \r\n 
		....

		Example:

		SEND \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 2 \r\n 
		1.1.1.1:1234 \r\n 
		192.168.1.1:9999 \r\n 
			
#### 2.3 Occasionally a member may wish to complain to the conductor about another member (the conductors response is implementation specific)
	
		COMP \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n IP:PORT \r\n

		Example:

		COMP \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 192.168.1.1:1234 \r\n
	
#### 2.4 It's possible that a member wants to announce to the conductor that they are sharing a new file
		
		UPLD \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <PORT> \r\n 

		Example:

		UPLD \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 9999 \r\n
		
		
### 3. Member-Member communications

####	3.1	When a member connects to another members for the first time it will typically ask for a list of available parts:
	
		DOWN \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n

		Example:

		DOWN \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 
		
#### 3.2 The second Member can make either of two replies:
	
##### 3.2.1 For some reason the second Member does not have the file at all: (note the zero included at the end of the message)
		
		NONE \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n 0 \r\n

		Example:

		NONE \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 0 \r\n
		
##### 3.2.2 The second Member has the file and replies with a binary encoded int, which details the list of parts
				
		SEND \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <INTEGER> \r\n

		Example:

		SEND \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 511 \r\n

The binary encoding is a bitwise representation of what parts are available:
A few examples:

E.g a file with 9 parts:

member has all parts: 

reply = 1023, which is 00000011 11111111 (note that we add a 1 in front of the number for saying that we start the expression of the parts and the leading zeroes in order to make this two bytes)

member has first and third part:

reply = 517, which is 00000010 00000101 (note that we add a 1 in front of the number for saying that we start the expression of the parts and the leading zeroes in order to make this two bytes)

E.g a file with 8 parts:

member has first, third and sixth parts:

reply = 293, which is 00000001 00100101 (note that the 1 added requires us to have an added byte)

In all cases the number of bytes will be the same, regardless of the whether a member has all parts or 0 parts.
i.e the number of bytes is floor((num_parts + 7)/8)
	
#### 3.3 Once the first Member has the list of parts, it will request a particular part with the following message:
	
		PART \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <INTEGER> \r\n

		Example:

		PART \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 5 \r\n
		
#### 3.4 The second Member now has two options:
	
##### 3.4.1 Send a message about the transfer of part, followed immediately by the part: note there is no newline after "DATA"
			
		STRT \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <INTEGER> \r\n <DATA>

		Example:

		STRT \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 5 \r\n 010010101010101010101010 ... 00001101
			
##### 3.4.2 For some reason the second member does not have this part and replies:
		
		NONE \r\n <FILENAME> \r\n <FULL_FILE_CHECKSUM> \r\n <INTEGER> \r\n

		Example:

		NONE \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 5 \r\n
	
	
### An example connection and transfer might go as follows:

1. 	Open .orch file to get conductor IP, checksums, part sizes, file size etc.

2. 	Member1 connects to the conductor and requests a list of IP:PORT with:
    
		DOWN \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 

3. Conductor replies with the list of IP:PORT:

		SEND \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 2 \r\n 
		1.1.1.1:1234 \r\n 
		192.168.1.1:9999 \r\n 

4. Member1 connects to Member2 at IP:PORT 1.1.1.1:1234 and requests list of parts:

		DOWN \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 
		
5. Member2 replies with list of parts encoded in an int:

		SEND \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 511 \r\n
		
6. Member1 requests a particular part from members2 available parts:

		PART \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 5 \r\n
		
7. Member2 starts the transfer of the requested part:

		STRT \r\n maxresdefault.jpg \r\n 2953289a34e0cc2bf776decc3f8b86622d66b705 \r\n 5 \r\n 010010101010101010101010 ... 00001101
		
8. GOTO 6. and repeat until all parts have been copied. (Note that in reality there are many members and many simultaneous part requests to different members, but the details of this are implementation specific)
