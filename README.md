## Subject

The objective of this project was to create a peer-to-peer filesharing program with the following features.
This is the collaborative work of 4 students: Jorge Chang, Sejal Jaiswal, Arslen Remaci and Edward Beeching.

### Composer
A small utility program that will take an input Composition (file) and generate a small Orchestra (.orch) file that can be used to share the large input file. An example orchestra file is as follows:

### Conducter
A networked program that provides IP:ports of users that are sharing parts of the Composition.

### Member 
The core program that is used to get/share the Composition, this requires the .orch file to know details of which composition to share/download.

## Instructions for using the program

### Dependancies
The software is tested to run on Python 3.5, it may work on Python 2.7 but this has not been tested.
The following dependancy is included in the GitHub repository **progressbar2-3.12.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl** , this can be installed with pip or any other wheel installation package, be sure that it is installing to python3 as some systems default to python2. Note the .whl file is cross-platform and has been tested on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX.

For installation, simply clone the GitHub repository. **Note there is a .gitignore on a directory called "logs" so you will need to make this directory yourself otherwise there will be an error writing the log file.**

### Using the Composer
In order to share a new file the composer can be used from the command line.

There are 3 options:

    composer.py filename
    composer.py filename conductor_ip_port
    composer.py filename conductor_ip_port part_size

If the ip and port are note know, the file line of the text file generated can be updated at a later stage.

### Using the Conductor

The conductor can be run from the command line with conductor.py as new members connect the conductor will maintain a list of IP:port of connected members.


### Using the Member

To use the member to share/get a file run **member.py orch_filename** the member will then get the file. A small progress bar is shown with the parts remaining and percentage, you can press q at any time to quit (this may take up to 5 seconds to cleaning close all conections)

## System Architecture
### Simple UML Diagram of Member

Classes commiunicate through messages on blocking queues. The use of queues allows for easy testing of individual classes and functions.
